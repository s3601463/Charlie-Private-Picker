
	var PD = "||>Project||========================================================================================================================================||>Overview||========================================================================================================================================|| The group idea for an IT project would be a chatbot which is used on many platforms; Android/IOS, web-based and a physical medium.| This chatbot is designed to create a complete PC system build for a customer by asking relevant and intuitive questions regarding what their main uses for the computer would be and sifting through selected answers to the prescribed questions and creating a complete PC build for the customer’s need. The physical, mobile, and web-based chatbots would all be the same, but target a separate audience, for the youth market, it would be the app based, but for those who don’t have a phone or struggle using a computer/web-based platform, would try the physical instore chatbot. The main outcome of this project is that the original problem with people not knowing where to go to find information and help in building a system, are able to use a simple chatbot interface to determine what kind of PC they need. This would open a service which anyone can use to find a PC right for them. The overall impact would be the realisation that we are living in the current generation where PC’s are all around us, and not everyone knows how to build or let alone come up with hardware for someone else to build one. It would force companies to widen their overall knowledge of the IT industry to one where anyone can easily get help.||========================================================================================================================================||>Motivation|| According to “Bustle.com”, on average, a desktop pc lasts around 4 years until it needs a major upgrade. The need for custom built systems is prevalent. This is the main motivation for the proposed project as there is an ongoing market for consumers who need a new computer system.| This is where the chatbot comes in. Using a simple touchscreen interface, the chatbot can ask any user their needs and requirements for a computer and based on that information can provide a full configured system build to their specifications which then the customer can purchase. One of the main motivators would be allowing all ages of people to keep up with current PC practises and hardware; especially for the elderly can keep up with the more power efficient hardware. For future employers, this will show how the group is able to understand key issue and problems which need to be fixed; specifically this project, it shows how there is a gap in the market for elderly or people who are not knowledgeable regarding PC building and the type of parts needed to suit their needs.||========================================================================================================================================||>Landscape|| In terms of competition with the PC builder there are many different variants. However, our idea is more widely available for people of all ages and knowledge regarding PC building. Some of the more common products that most PC enthusiasts would know are PC Part Picker, which is a web-based platform which helps users to plan out a complete PC building keeping in mind if the parts are compatible or not. However, there is one major downfall; if a person has never in their life built a PC or even has any knowledge about PC hardware, problems can arise where users can create a PC build with components they may not need. For example, is an elderly person decided to create a pc list, they might think they need a dedicated graphics card, when in reality if they are using their computer for light usage,(Web browsing, Skyping, watching the occasional video) ,they are wasting money on components they may not need. On the other hand, there are places which have pre-determined spec out PC ranging from different price points; however, they are only really geared towards gamers. This is where our product comes in. We have come up with an idea which solves the hassle of going and buying the parts to build a pc or even knowing where to start when upgrading or buying a system. With a small questionnaire a user can get provided with a system which suits their own needs. It doesn’t have to be gaming orientated but tailored for any use. ||========================================================================================================================================||>Detailed Description||========================================================================================================================================||>Aims|| The main aim of this project is to successfully implement a chatbot style interface which the product can be deployed into major retailers and give the ability for users to have a tailored made PC right for their needs. The key elements for this to be successful would be; for the chatbot to formulate a bespoke PC based off the customers response to the chatbot’s questions, additionally there would be a need for a site where the PC can be built.|| Creation of the chatbot:| My main features of the service are supported on how the chatbot works. One of the goals for the product is to make a simple chat bot. This will be done through a very simple yes or no questionnaire. This will allow for any one customer, no matter the age difference, to be able to understand the questions and answer based on their need so that they can get a pc personalised for them. These questions would include; Are you a gamer, are you a graphic designer or video producer. If the answer was no, it would eliminate all graphics cards from the end system, saving consumers money. For those who are elderly it would ask them what kind of size of the pc system they would want it. This would eliminate all large ATX motherboards in preference of mATX motherboards and thus larger cases. The chatbot would also ask if they store a lot of movies/tv shows/ photos. If they do, they would prioritize larger HDD, and maybe add a SSD if necessary. At the end there would be a printout of the built system specs and price. The customer then would have the option to purchase and get it built that day for a premium price.|| Another goal would be having the site and resources to build PC. This could be achieved offsite the build list is sent to the build station off site. Here employees would receive the part list and build the system based on when the customer wants it by. If they pay extra for same day building their custom pc build would be prioritized compared to those who didn’t pay for same day build. In addition to the service, the customer can use the specially generated build code which allows them to track the progress of their build, down to the component. Eg. There would be a button the builder would press based on what component they would be inserting into the case. This would allow the consumer to know what point the builder is up to and gives an estimation of when the computer will be able to be picked up. For the youth market or people on the go, the mobile/web-based service provides the same outcome but with a user-friendly UI. It has the same functionality with the yes or no question chatbot, but it saves the user having to go into the store to purchase the computer. The service will also have a home deliver component so that from the comfort of your home you can order. The consumer is guaranteed a pc system built to their needs.||========================================================================================================================================||>Plans and Progress|| Our project idea, as you already know, is to create a chatbot that can be used on many different platforms such as on a computer (web-based), a phone (android and IOS) or on a separate physical medium. The main purpose of this chatbot is too create a complete PC system which is built for the customer based on relevant data gathered through questions regarding the main use of the PC. All the different platforms will cater to each individual market. For example, the older generation, who may struggle using a phone, will be able to use the instore chatbot. As mentioned previously with-in our overview, the main outcome is to fix our original problem, which was people being unsure where to find information regarding how to build a specific system, and in achieving this, we hope to provide an interface where anyone can determine what kind of PC they need.|| When it comes to developing the project, no physically work has been done however there are plans in the nearby future to perhaps organise a team and give the project a go. We would organise probably a small team as a large team wouldn’t be required of simple chatbot and this team would easily develop the appropriate and required solution in terms of a full functional, error free chatbot.|| The idea of the chatbot came from one our group members Josh as he felt that personally that the ongoing market for consumers who need a computer is rising so there should be some sort of chatbot which would assist with helping these consumers build their ideal PC and as a group we couldn’t agree more and that’s why we all agreed to back his idea in and run with it. The need custom built systems are prevalent and there would be no better option to help assist this other than our chatbot.|| Another major influence of the Chatbot came from a Bustle article which discussed the ideal time to purchase a new computer. They determined that every 3 to 5 years you should look to upgrade. We depicted that with-in this time frame, the user is bound to have problems as the computer they had probably wasn’t their ideal PC and after this time frame, they wouldn’t know exactly what hardware they would upgrade to, so the purpose of the chatbot is to ease this process and allow the user the freedom to answer some simple questions which in turn, would provide them with the ideal laptop/desktop that they require, for whatever situation they’re in.|| In terms of the actual project, there have been several small changes made since the original idea was discussed. Originally the chatbot was only going to be web-based to start off with, with the idea to push to other platforms to come later, however we changed this so all would be available from the day of release, whenever that may be. Another slight change we made as well was to make sure a trained employee was on hand at instore booths to help assists customers if they do require help using the service, rather than just having an on-screen help system that may be simple, but however with the unpredictable of the user, may appear complex.| Another aspect of chatterbot that has been changed was the original target audience. Originally, the idea of a PC customisable chatbot was to be catered towards a gaming standpoint with PC gamers having the opportunity to build there gaming PC to their liking easily without too much hassle. Eventually we realised that we could defiantly reach a wider audience if we changed our focus to suit everyone because at the end of the day, you’re going to get more people using your product alongside more companies wanting your product if it caters to people of all ages.|| Even though we believe our product is at a very high standard currently, there’s always room for improvement and currently, were looking to perfect the chatbot. We are planning on adding some sort of language translator which would make the chatbot available worldwide and not just in English speaking countries. We feel this is a necessity however currently isn’t in our plans to add, however will defiantly be added sometime in the future.| Alongside this, we discussed potentially adding some sort of login system where you can login and save your questions/answers so for example if you don’t have enough time in store to complete all your questions, you can login, save your progress and either potentially come back another day or login via the phone app to complete it. This of course has only been discussed briefly so this feature may not be developed anytime soon, buts it’s something we defiantly are planning on adding at a future date.|| Another aspect we intend on finetuning is the simplicity of the chatbot. Currently, we have questions which eventually will narrow down a specific PC designed for the user, however we do plan on making this process as simple as possible. If the user is of an older age, the questions will be simpler and easier to understand in contrast to a gamer for example, who would presumably know their stuff, therefore the questions will be a little more complex and in depth for the PC to be perfect for the person. We mainly are just looking to perfect the questions and pathways so users can get the best experience and eventuate with the best computer at the end of the day.|| Overall, we are just planning on making the best Chatbot we can, whether it turns out perfect will wait to be seen. We have all the plans on paper, now it’s just about getting a team together and developing the finished product, as mentioned above, changes will probably be made on top of the already changed features and planned features but with this you never know, we may changes major aspects of the chatbot in the future but currently this is the plan we have and hopefully we see it through and it turns out as wehope.||========================================================================================================================================||>Roles|| Throughout the Project we for the most part haven’t had set roles for each of the group members, as the large majority of us have had overlapping skills. For certain tasks, some of us have had more of a background in a certain area, such as Jared’s affinity for website creation, so some of us have had more input into certain designs than others, meaning that we have been able to utilise the strengths of each individual members, but also ensuring that each person gets their fair share of work.|| The process for our group mainly began and was comprised of divvying up the tasks required for completion of the task at hand, with some of this being allocated to those who were best at the task, while others were given tasks that no-one had a specific skill for, but still needed to be done. This approach to the completion of tasks meant that all tasks were completed to the best of our group’s abilities, as well as all tasks actually being finished in the end.||========================================================================================================================================||>Scopes and Limits|| Due to our project being made to be implemented into the wide IT commercial world as a product there is always a threat of trying to employ too many features and add-ons while pursuing complete customer satisfaction or overall market presence.| With this project at hand the first visible restraint is the language used to communicate with potential customers as quite clearly it would initially be limited to just English language. This would most likely be until enough data and experience is gathered in local market to then expand globally to other non-English speaking regions. || Second area that will need to be given serious discussion is the amount of different hardware available to the Part-picker to choose from. This is because there is simply too many brands and different models of hardware that do the same tasks in a PC. If we include too many products in our database it would make Chatbot programming exceptionally complicated and tedious additionally to having to run extra trials. Furthermore, from the warehousing and inventory management perspective it just might not be possible or financially viable. That is because with such overwhelming number of parts some are almost guaranteed to be lost in transit and some others to never leave the warehouse shelf.||========================================================================================================================================||>Tools and Technologies|| The application requires the choice of programming language required to creating the program and the IDE used to develop to it. The JetBrains “All Product Pack” license is required to develop our project as it will give us access to multiple different tool software’s provided by JetBrains. However, the main reason for this is to get around the use of the IntelliJ IDEA license costing a large portion more and the “All Product Pack” costs a fixed amount per user. Another option for us is, Visual Studio 2019 version 16.1. The programming languages that can be utilised to develop the program can be either Java, C++ or C#. Java would require IntelliJ and, C++ and C# would require Visual Studio. An Adobe software license is required to develop the interface and icons used by the application. Adobe Photoshop CC 2019 (20.0.4), Adobe Indesign CC 2019 (14.0.2) and Adobe Illustrator CC  2019 (23.0.3). Office 365 business license is a possible investment that would utilise the ability to change data required by the program.| The following hardware is required: A Kiosk setup (Physical housing), a computer running Windows 10 OS, a physical connection to the servers. The clients will require an area to store the parts if they are to build them on site which would involve storage costs and costs of the items. These costs can be reduced with bulk acquisition/ purchase of the parts. The costs of storage will largly depend on the number of stock they chose to hold for the parts. Another client cost to be considered is the cost for the server that the kiosk needs to be connected.| If the client already has a server then their IT, networking engineers, staff will need to connect the kiosk to the network in order to send the data to the necessary channels.|| In Jesus Chirst and the Apostles, there are three users that can use Adobe Photoshop with one of them also being able to use Adobe Illustrator. This group would utilise and design the images used to create UI for our kiosk setup. Five of our members have a basic understanding of how to use Java however only one of them have ever used IntelliJ to develop Java programs before. One member also has experience with both C++ and C# and has utilised Microsoft Visual Studio before.| Another member of our group has experience in management which could help organise storage in both setting up an area for storage and acquisition of the parts. In terms of setting up the network, two of our members have completed our CCNA with one currently working on achieving this goal. Overall our group has a good understanding of the aspects required to complete this project.||========================================================================================================================================||>Testing|| When Creating this project, the testing process would be a very lengthy and tedious procedure. Our initial round of testing would begin once we mostly completed or fully completed the chatbot generating part picker. We would have to test to see whether the algorithm is able to search through the database and to find the appropriate parts that would be suitable based on some input criteria. Since this would just be a functionality test, the only people made available to test the program are the group members, to make sure our application is working as intended, but will probably be the bulk of the trial and error testing.|| At this point of the build, the user interface would mostly not be created, as it will just be the bare bone software being tested. Once we are satisfied with our part picking procedure and we are certain of what will be included in the end application, we will start working on User Design aspect of the application. We would firstly create a base design and layout based on what we believe is possible to be included in the application overall. || We will proceed to do a small closed group sample test. Around 10-20 users will be selected to initially test our app. They will be given an overall end goal to achieve based on a small criteria, and will be left on their own to try and achieve the end goal successfully. || Based on the responses given from those testers, we will then further tidy up the whole application and add some life improvement changes as requested. Finally, depending on how we feel about the application, we will either open it to the public for an online public testing and repeat the finalization of our application, or just immediately release it to the public.";

	var PD2 = "||>Risks||========================================================================================================================================|| When we create this chatbot through the use of an our desired programming language, there are multiple factors associated with the creation that may affect our progress. Our group members are either beginners or intermediates at a specific coding language.| We may struggle to understand how to use the code to find precise responses from the user and how to tailor those responses into picking the right item suited for the user. We may also struggle with some of the coding concepts with making the code efficient and short, but overall we could learn all of the code as we produce the application.|| One of the biggest problems that we may encounter often, is not having the specific outcomes from the chatbot questionnaire. We would have to find the perfect balance between not making our responses too generalised and giving a wide spectrum of random parts. But the parts that are suggested from the chatbot must be specific enough to be desirable for the user, yet also not making the questionnaire a lengthy chore to complete. This will be often a big portion of our trial and error testing and we will have to find the perfect balance between the questions. || This would slow down the production of the application making process and alternatively if issues arise later on which would more than likely occur, we are possibly unable to fix them with our limited knowledge.|| The major intent of users utilizing our chatbot, would be to have an auto generated custom pc build that fulfills the users requirements. This would take into consideration additional options such as pricing, looks, compatibility and performance to name a few. Our pc part database would need to constantly be up to date with information on the newest parts and even cover any updates on older generations, this would include the individual pricing for the item, the size and look of the item, the features and specifications of the item. All of the information generated from this research will be used in the directory of part lists that the chatbot could access and extract. || Our last part of the application is when users get their build brought to life in other retail shops. We would have to contract a system with these retailers to allow us to send them build requests to their shops, where they would have to complete in a certain amount of time. As we are not dealing with just staff in our company, we will need to organise a system with those retailers for them to have some staff available at all times to start on any build requests. If we fail to have an organised system with these external retailers, we could lose a lot of revenue and customers, and that would have a negative impact on the application reviews.|| All of these factors would be critical in creating a proper pc build through a chatbot. If the application fails to include any features or makes any mistake in the compatibility of the items, the user will end up being misinformed, and may possibly waste a large amount of money on a build that they are not satisfied with. ||>Group Processes and Communications||========================================================================================================================================|| Our group will be using the same means of communication as for the previous submission with most of the discussion happening over Facebooks Messenger. However we will also meet face-to-face on a weekly basis most likely during or after our Friday class. That meeting time will purely be used to help each other sort out issues and questions that will undoubtedly arise during the project work. But most work will still be done from the comfort of members homes. We have besides agreed to use Google Drive to store and combine all our work as some members require access to parts done by others in order to do theirs.";
	
	var SJ = ">Skills and Jobs|| Currently, the group would benefit from a few things, mainly some strong management, maybe another well-versed programmer so we don't solely rely on Jared for the programming expertise, a person who has business contacts or is able to market our creation, and someone who is able to design more intricate and specific images required for this task, however the group would also require the candidate or employee to be able to integrate and fit into the group in a natural way, and fit with the group's meme culture.| Therefore, the jobs would be as follows:|| IT Manager || Jesus Christ and the 12 Apostles are currently hiring a manager, looking for someone with the following attributes: |~ - Group Management|~ - Strong Sense of Leadership|~ - Able to Meme (key requirement)| If you feel that you're able to fill all these requirements, we'd like to hear from you by calling us on 123 - 555 - 6789 || Programmer || Jesus Christ and the 12 Apostles are currently hiring a programmer, looking for someone with the following attributes:|~ - Programming Skills (basic to intermediate)|~ - Ability to think outside the box|~ - Able to meme (key requirement)| If you feel that you're able to fill all these requirements, we'd like to hear from you by calling us on 123 - 555 - 6789|| Business Client Manager || Jesus Christ and the 12 Apostles are currently hiring a client manager, looking for someone with the following attributes:|~ - Ability to make and retain business clients|~ - A wealth of current technology and electronics clients and partners|~ - Ability to meme (key requirement)| If you feel that you're able to fill all these requirements, we'd like to hear from you by calling us on 123 - 555 - 6789|| Graphic Designer || Jesus Christ and the 12 Apostles are currently hiring a manager, looking for someone with the following attributes:|~- Skills and Experience in Graphic Design |~- Ability to bring wild ideas to life |~- Able to meme (key requirement) | If you feel that you're able to fill all these requirements, we'd like to hear from you by calling us on 123 - 555 - 6789";
	var GR = ">Group Reflection|| Jared Makhoul || I felt that the group work this time was a bit more organised than the last assignment. Every completed their tasks on time. Planning the work out was a lot faster than last time, everyone understood what they needed to do and we helped each other out accordingly. Most communications were completed through Facebook Messenger. The base of the website was created initially as to make the rest of it easier to accomplish when all the data was on hand. We went with an IBM console look this time, It was the only thing I had left under my belt. I felt work was distributed evenly and that all of us did a great job. || Matthew Sesto || Personally, I thought the group worked relatively well as a unit. We all contributed to a fair share of the assignment with no complaints from all of us. We all got along very well, just as we did in assignment 2 and obviously once again this helped us as even though we didn’t always use our in-class time as effectively as we could, our common interests helped as bond which made it easier outside of the classroom to organise what needed to be done without any trouble. One thing that surprised me actually was how quickly all us lads got on, and as I mentioned above, it honestly really did help us, if we had a couple of outsiders in the group who really were just there to make up the numbers I feel that the assignment wouldn’t have run as smoothly and easily as it did. This time for assignment 3 compared to assignment 2 I think we definitetly planned it out better ahead of time and it was clear to each person what their role was with-in the assignment. No complaints from my end. || Joshua Christopher Dyson Sykes || Overall for this project I think that everyone was able to do their own jobs to a pretty high standard. Learning from the previous group assignment, everyone was able to get their work done with ample time to spare, though better time management.| The only real issue which could easily be fixed is the sharing option for the google drive folder use this time to upload and collaborate for our individual parts. For the most part, communication was much better, and everyone responded to any queries quite quickly.| Overall, I think we did a much better job and collaborating and helping each other more, which proved to be beneficial to the overall outcome of the project. || Michael Vella || I think that the group really go into it's stride, everything was much better handled in comparison to the previous assignment, however things were completed to the same if not a higher standard. While we were still able to joke around and maintain the groups casual and "+'"jokey"'+" nature, we were able complete our tasks on time, and there isn't really any other metric I believe that we could judge the quality of the group by. I think what could be improved could be utilising the time in class maybe a little better but I think this comes from us being better as separate workers. I was surprised by the standard of work that my group-mates were able to put in, as the standard was set very high by those around me. I learned that when we plan things out earlier it's much easier to get things done in a proper timeframe. || Jin Yap || With this group project we all worked well together and evenly distributed to work to all members. No one made a fuss about allocations of tasks and everyone did their tasks to high standard. We all also asked each other for proofreading for each other's work and it helped our overall assignment, I felt like similar to last time we left our assignment to the last minute, but still managed to complete it. Our communication was also lacking to a degree as we all focused on our own parts and had very different schedules. I found surprising that our group was still able to complete the assignment with our busy schedules and lack of communication. Group work I learned, is all about dividing the work into manageable parts and all helping each other when we encounter obstacles.|| Fjodor Zadonski || This time around I would say our group performed in an even smoother way compared to previous assignment. The parts and roles were divided up weeks in advance allowing for good and though through planning/writing. It was again pleasant and simple to communicate with each group member and this time there didn’t seem to be any mess-ups requiring last minute editing. Everyone in the team is friendly, well-mannered and always happy to assist if anything was confusing. On my part I could’ve been more proactive with my ideas during group discussions but the fact, that I am least qualified from purely IT standpoint, held me back. || Overall Reflection: || Going from the collection of the group reflections, we all seem to be much happier with the organisation of the group, while it wasn't perfect, it was much better than it was, and due to the earlier division of tasks, it was much easier for all of us to complete our tasks earlier and to a higher standard. The only real issues that some of had was that while the organisation improved, it could still be a little bit better, and the Google Drive was a little confusing and hard to use, but overall was useful for what it needed to be used for.| Overall the group seems to have had a positive experience this time around.|";
	var AR = ">Tools (Audit Report)||Our group chose to a project based on creating system which generates a number of different questions and allocates parts to produce a built computer system. This would be determined by a specific list of closed ended questions and have an algorithm based on this to best choose the parts.||We chose to utilise Google Drive instead of github as our base repository for uploading and sharing work between each other. The shared repository, Google Drive, that we chose to use does not display the contribution levels that well as others can change and data on other peoples work. It also does not display the contribution that each person has achieved. The github repository does display this however the amount of work an individual completes is not 100% accurate as each person can complete a separate amount of work to the rest and only upload a single document which would be displayed in the repository. If each person was to only upload a single document the repository would display that each person has completed 1/6th, approximately 16.7%, contribution. That being said, the github repository is a better way to determine the contribution of work.| In our case, we chose to ignore this and choose a quicker and easier to access platform to share and organise work.||>Website link: https://s3601463.github.io/Charlie-Private-Picker/|>Group repository: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GLwRYRm4_xEv7bm3pq1oZh3nO5l0Jv0K?usp=sharing|>The website repository: https://github.com/s3601463/Charlie-Private-Picker|";
